# Malaria-Cell-Classification---MLP
The project focused on developing a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) network to distinguish the cells infected due to Malaria.The MLP network primarily focused on the classification of four different types of cell categories: “red blood cell”, “ring”, “schizont” and “trophozoite”. Since the dataset turned out to be an imbalanced one, accuracy is not considered as the best metric for finding the model. The metrics: macro-averaged F1-score and the Cohen’s Kappa score were used to measure the performance of the models.
During the seven-day challenge, the best model developed had an average score (F1-score and Kappa score) of 0.85.
